## About The Project

**CodeUtsava X — Glitch × Illusion** is the 10th edition of the flagship event organized by the **Turing Club of Programmers (TCP)**, the official coding club of NIT Raipur.

CodeUtsava has grown into a celebration of technology, creativity, problem-solving, and community. With its tenth edition, CodeUtsava X introduces a new visual and conceptual identity built around the theme **Glitch × Illusion**.

The website serves as the digital gateway to the event — bringing together participants, organizers, mentors, speakers, sponsors, and the wider developer community.

### What is CodeUtsava X?

CodeUtsava X is more than just a coding competition. It is a technology-focused celebration designed to bring students and developers together through:

* 💻 **Hackathon** — Build innovative solutions to real-world problems
* 🧠 **Workshops & Learning** — Learn from developers, mentors, and industry professionals
* ⚡ **Coding & Technical Challenges** — Test your problem-solving and technical skills
* 🌐 **Community Building** — Connect with students, developers, mentors, and technology enthusiasts
* 🏆 **Competition & Recognition** — Compete, build, learn, and earn recognition
* 🎨 **Creativity & Innovation** — Turn ideas into meaningful technological experiences

Participants from across the country can take part in the various activities conducted as part of CodeUtsava X and become a part of the CodeUtsava community.

## Built With

The frontend currently uses the following stack:

### Frontend

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) — React framework for building the website
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) — Utility-first CSS framework
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) — Fast and efficient package manager

### Backend integration

This repository contains the **frontend website only**. If backend services are introduced, they should be consumed through documented external APIs and configured with environment variables.

---

## Theme — Glitch × Illusion

**Glitch × Illusion** is the central creative direction of CodeUtsava X.

The theme explores the space between **what is real and what appears to be real** — where digital imperfections become visual identities, familiar interfaces distort, and reality itself feels like a system experiencing an unexpected glitch.

### Theme Elements

The CodeUtsava X experience draws inspiration from:

* 🌀 **Illusion** — Distorting perception and challenging what the viewer expects
* ⚡ **Glitch** — Digital errors transformed into visual expression
* 🖥️ **Digital Reality** — Interfaces, systems, code, and technology as part of the visual language
* 👁️ **Perception** — Making users question what they see
* 🔀 **Distortion** — Breaking conventional layouts and interactions
* 🧩 **Hidden Layers** — Revealing unexpected information and experiences
* 💻 **Technology & Creativity** — Blending engineering with artistic expression

### The Experience

The website aims to feel less like a conventional event website and more like an **interactive digital world**.

Elements may appear fragmented, distorted, displaced, or unexpectedly transformed — creating an experience where users continuously move between structure and chaos.

The **glitch** represents the unexpected.

The **illusion** represents perception.

Together, they create the identity of **CodeUtsava X**.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the CodeUtsava X website locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your system.

* [Node.js 24 LTS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [pnpm 10.25.0](https://pnpm.io/installation)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installing pnpm

If pnpm is not already installed:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm@10.25.0
```

Verify the installation:

```sh
node --version
pnpm --version
git --version
```

### Local Repository Setup

Please follow the project's contribution guidelines when submitting changes. We follow a standard fork-and-pull workflow for contributions.

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a separate branch** for your changes
4. **Make and test your changes**
5. **Commit** your work with a meaningful commit message
6. **Push** your branch to your fork
7. **Open a Pull Request** for review

Repository:

https://github.com/TCP-Tech/Codeutsava-X

### Running the Project

The CodeUtsava X frontend uses **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **pnpm**.

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone --branch dev --single-branch https://github.com/TCP-Tech/Codeutsava-X.git
cd Codeutsava-X

pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Start the development server:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

The website should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Run the complete local quality check before opening a pull request:

```sh
pnpm check
```

### Production Build

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the deployed origin so canonical URLs, social
metadata, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml` point to production. Vercel's
production URL is detected automatically when that variable is omitted.

Create a production build:

```sh
pnpm build
```

Start the production server:

```sh
pnpm start
```

### Managing Dependencies

Add a package:

```sh
pnpm add package_name
```

Add a development dependency:

```sh
pnpm add -D package_name
```

Remove a package:

```sh
pnpm remove package_name
```
